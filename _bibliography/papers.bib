  abstract={Current slot-oriented approaches for compositional scene segmentation from images and videos rely on provided background information or slot assignments. We present a segmented location and identity tracking system, Loci-Segmented (Loci-s), which does not require either of this information. It learns to dynamically segment scenes into interpretable background and slotbased object encodings, separating rgb, mask, location, and depth information for each. The results reveal largely superior video decomposition performance in the MOVi datasets and in another established dataset collection targeting scene segmentation. The systemâ€™s well-interpretable, compositional latent encodings may serve as a foundation model for downstream tasks.},
